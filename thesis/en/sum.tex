The toolkit is a great help for most of the used cases, it can speed up searching things in the history.
However, there are some cases when its unusable, for example, if we try to run it for extremely large repositories
for instance, the Linux kernel, it can cause out of memory errors. To solve the database, it should be able to store more
information. The other problem is that currently the parser and the runner are both single threaded.
They should be parallelized to be able to use the whole resource of the PC.
